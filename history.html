        Sassoon General Hospitals is a large state-run hospital in Pune, India with 1296 beds. It is affiliated to the B. J. Medical College and a Nurses training School. Sassoon Hospital caters to 9,426,959 population of Pune District- a 2nd most populous district in the State of Maharashtra.
   The Jewish philanthropist David Sassoon from Mumbai made a generous donation to make the construction of the hospital possible in 1867. The hospital could originally accommodate 144 patients.
       The campus had already been blessed by the presence of two great personalities - Avtar Meher Baba was born in the old maternity ward in the hospital, and the father of the nation, Mahatma, Gandhi was operated upon for emergency appendectomy in 1924 by a British Surgeon Col. Murdoch with an Indian anaesthetist Dr. Datey in attendance.
     <p class="w3-text-grey">The first Principal of the B. J. Medical College, which started with 50 students, was Dr. B. B. Dikshit, a renowned academician and the quiet mastery of Dr. Bhende, discipline of Dr. Balwani have left an indelible imprint on the young impressionable minds of innumerable students, in their formative years, who in turn have imbibed these sterling qualities to give back the best to society. For many years annually 200 students are admitted for MBBS graduation and 143 for postgraduation. At any given time now 1700 students are on the campus with more than 2000 staff including 268 faculties. Presently, courses of MBBS, MD, MS, PhD, Diplomas, MCh (CVTS), MSc, GNM, BSc Nursing, DMLT, PGDMCH, and PGDGM are offered here</p>

        Pune had already been blessed by the generous contribution of Sassoon- a Jewish merchant family in the form of the David Sassoon Hospital (Old Sassoon Building) built at a cost of Rs. 213,000 serving the poor and needy from 1867, and the Jacob Sassoon Hospital constructed by his nephew in 1905-06 to relieve the congestion on the David Sassoon Hospital. Both were magnificent buildings, architectural marvels and the clock tower of David Sassoon Hospital, a landmark in the city. 
        <p class="w3-text-grey">
      In year 1946 on 23rd June, B. J. Medical College was founded to replace erstwhile B. J. Medical School, with Shri. B. G. Kher the head of the Bombay Government, laying the foundation stone. This was the fulfilment of the vision of a far sighted Parsi philanthropist Byramjee Jeejeebhoy, to have an institution in Poona for training of doctors and providing medical facilities on par with those in Bombay. His generosity and munificence made it possible for the B.J. Medical School to start functioning from 1871 on land donated by him, and when the school was upgraded to the college in 1946, quite filtergly the name was retained.
      On this hallowed ground, came up the B. J. Medical college (BJMC) and the Sassoon Hospital (New Sassoon Building) facing each other with a unique architectural style of both buildings having two white pillars bearing elephant heads at the top. The main building of BJMC was inaugurated by Dr. Radha Krishnan in 1952.
